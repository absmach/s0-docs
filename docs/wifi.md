# Connecting S0 to WiFi

Since S0 is based on ESP32C6 which has WiFi capabilities, it can be configured in Station Mode or Access Point Mode.

Ensure you are in the `embedded/targets/zephyr/m0-wifi` directory

## Access Point Mode

To configure the S0 as an access point, configure the parameters in `src/config.h` to your preference.

Set parameters like `WIFI_AP_SSID` and `WIFI_AP_PSK` to your preference.
An example being:

```code
/* AP Mode Configuration */
#define WIFI_AP_SSID       "M0-AP"
#define WIFI_AP_PSK        ""
#define WIFI_AP_IP_ADDRESS "192.168.4.1"
#define WIFI_AP_NETMASK    "255.255.255.0"
```

## Station Mode

To configure S0 in station mode, configure the WiFi ssid and password as shown in `src/config.h`

```code
/* STA Mode Configuration */
#define WIFI_SSID "SSID"     /* Replace `SSID` with WiFi ssid. */
#define WIFI_PSK  "PASSWORD" /* Replace `PASSWORD` with Router password. */
```

## Bulding and Flashing Code

Build the code and upload it to S0:

```bash
west build -p always -b esp32c6_devkitc
west flash
west espressif monitor
```

See the logs from the Serial Monitor to check whether S0 is connected.
