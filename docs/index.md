![IoT Gateway Block Diagram](/images/s0-front.jpg)

The S0 is a robust and modular **IoT Gateway** for smart metering applications. The gateway is capable of collecting data from both **Wireless M-Bus (wMBus)** and **wired M-Bus** utility meters, and transmitting the collected data securely to a remote IoT platform over the internet.

## 🚀 Overview

The IoT Gateway is built around the **ESP32-C6** microcontroller, leveraging its RISC-V core and integrated wireless capabilities. It supports both **wireless and wired M-Bus protocols**, commonly used in heat, water, and gas meters for energy monitoring in industrial and residential environments.
