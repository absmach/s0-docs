## üîß Hardware Architecture

The gateway provides support for the following communication interfaces:

- üì∂ **Wireless M-Bus (868 MHz)** via the **RC-S2LP module**
- üîå **Wired M-Bus** via onboard bus driver circuitry
- üåê **NB-IoT / LTE-M** via the **SIM7080G** module for cellular connectivity
- üì° **LoRa (868 MHz)** via the **RAK3172** module for long-range, low-power communication
- üåç **Internet connectivity** via NB-IoT, Ethernet (optional), or LoRaWAN (via backend gateway)

The custom PCB integrates multiple communication modules and power interfaces designed for industrial deployment:

| Component       | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ESP32-C6       | Main microcontroller (RISC-V, WiFi, BLE)    |
| RC-S2LP        | Wireless M-Bus 868 MHz transceiver           |
| RAK3172        | LoRa module (868 MHz)                        |
| SIM7080G       | NB-IoT/LTE-M module                          |
| Wired M-Bus    | Driver interface for traditional M-Bus meters |
| Ethernet       | (Optional) for local network connectivity    |
| USB-C & Terminals | For power and debug                       |
| GNSS Support   | Optional via SIM7080G for asset tracking     |

The board is compact and optimized for IP-rated DIN-rail enclosures for industrial/outdoor environments. It features side-mounted SMA connectors for each antenna (WiFi, GNSS, LoRa, NB-IoT, wMBus).

## üåê Software Functionality

The gateway firmware performs the following functions:

- Collects meter data periodically from both wired and wireless M-Bus meters.
- Transmits structured data securely to, Magistrala a remote IoT platform via MQTT.
- Manages reconnections and retry logic for unreliable NB-IoT networks.
- Logs diagnostics and status via UART or remote logging service.
