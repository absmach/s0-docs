# Connecting S0 to SuperMQ

## Connection to Magistrala

The S0 board is designed to connect to an IoT application called **Magistrala**, which manages and visualizes data from connected devices.  
Magistrala uses **SuperMQ** as its core messaging backbone, providing scalable, high-performance message routing and topic-based data distribution.

S0 devices communicate with **SuperMQ** over the supported protocols (MQTT, HTTPS, CoAP, etc.) to publish and subscribe to IoT data streams securely.

## SuperMQ Setup Guide

A detailed guide will be provided to help users set up **SuperMQ** and establish a secure connection between the S0 board and the Magistrala IoT platform.  
This will include:

- SuperMQ server installation and configuration
- Certificate generation for secure connections (mTLS/DTLS)
- Configuring topics for S0 device data exchange
- Verifying communication between S0 and Magistrala
